LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROJECT :-



ABSTRACT

•	In today’s world, management of data has become of paramount importance for any organisation. More so, if the organisation happens to be a library. So through this project we intend to develop an E-Library interface which can be used for management of library books. The user can either sign in as the administrator or could do so as a student. He / She  can subsequently select any operation from the given list of options. The project has been developed in the C++ programming language and uses the concepts of classes and objects , file handling , data structures and encryption.
